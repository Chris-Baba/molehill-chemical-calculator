**Molehill Chemical Calculator Help**

Quick Start

The easiest way to learn how to use Molehill Chemical Calculator is to jump right in with some examples.  HINT: Move this window to one side of so that you can read this and enter data at the same time.  

Fill in the information needed in box 1 and continue to box 4 and press the 'Calculate' button.

Example 1) Calculate how much Sodium Chloride (1 Molar stock solution / MW = 58.443) is needed to make 250 ml of a 1 mM desired solution.

> In box **1-Starting Reagent**, type in "Sodium Chloride" in the first text box and '58.443' in the 'Molecular Weight' box.
> 
> In box **2-Starting Reagent Concentration** click on the *Solution* radio button and type in '1.0' and select 'M' (Molar).
> 
> In Box **3-Desired Solution** click on the 'Solution Conc' radio button and type in '1.0' and select 'mM' (for milliMolar).  Then enter '250 ml' for the 'Final Volume Wanted' boxes.
> 
> In Box **4-Results**, click on 'Calculate' to get your answer.
> 
> If your answer looks correct you should click on the **'Add To Print List'** button to save or print.
