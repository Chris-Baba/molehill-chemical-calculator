**Linux**

Right now there is no general Linux installer due to the various requirements needed for each Linux distribution.  The Linux end user should first look for Molehill Chemical Calculator in their distribution's package repository and use that if available.

Distribution package maintainers, and skilled Linux end users can try to use the Molehill Chemical Calculator applications executable which is called `chemcalc` and is in the `molehill-linux-installer` subdirectory.  The dependicies needed can be found by using `ldd chemcalc` from your command line. or looking at `ldd-dependencies.txt` in the Molehill github source code.
